MediatorLiveData
MediatorLiveData is a subclass of LiveData that allows u to merge multiple
LiveData sources.
e.g If u have LiveData object in your UI that can be updated from a local
DB or a network. Then u can add foll. sources to the MediatorLiveData object:
1. LiveData object associated with data stored in DB
2. LiveData object associated with data accessed from the network

Your activity only needs to observe the MediatorLiveData object to
receive updates from both the sources.
