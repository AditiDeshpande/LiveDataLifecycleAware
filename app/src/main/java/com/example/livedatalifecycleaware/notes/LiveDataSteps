Steps to work with LiveData objects
1. create instance to hold a certain type of data. This uis usually
done within ViewModel class
2. Create an Observer object that defines onChanged() method, which
controls what happens when the LiveData object's held data changes.
Usually create an Observer object in an UI controller such as activity
or Fragment.
3. Attach Observer object to the LiveData using observe() method takes
a LifeCycleOwner object. This subscribes the Observer object to the
LiveData object so that it is notified of changes. U usually attach
Observer object in an UI controller , such as an activity / fragment

*Note:
u can register an observer without associated LifecycleOwner object
using observerForever(Observer) method. In this case , the observer
is considered to be always active and is therefore always notified
about notificatiobs. u can remove these observers calling
removeObserver(Observer) method.
